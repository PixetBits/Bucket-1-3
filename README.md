# BucketProgrammingLanguage
Bucket means Basic Unity Control to Kindle Eletrical Tapes. With bucket you can do simple scripts to read, edit, add, replace or anything a computer can do with user input. Like a sand castle.

# Hello world on Bucket:

      [to Basic]
      #helloworld in Bucket:
      
      bucket open:
      show 'Hello world!'
      end m.
      
      close.

This script imports the Basic library, declares a class named by the file name (helloworld.bk), and shows a string on the main method, ``bucket open:``.
